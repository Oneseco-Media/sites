## Project Overview

This is a minimal webpack starter template for building web applications. It includes a development server with hot reloading and a production build configuration. The main technologies used are Webpack 5, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This will open the application in your default web browser and automatically reload the page when you make changes to the code.

## Scripts

The following scripts are available in the `package.json` file:

*   `npm start`: Starts the development server.
*   `npm run build`: Builds the application for production.
*   `npm test`: Runs the test suite (currently not implemented).
*   `npm run predeploy`: Builds the application before deploying.
*   `npm run deploy`: Deploys the application to GitHub Pages.

## Project Structure

The project structure is as follows:

*   `css/`: Contains the CSS files for the application.
*   `js/`: Contains the JavaScript files for the application.
*   `img/`: Contains the images for the application.
*   `index.html`: The main HTML file for the application.
*   `webpack.common.js`: The common webpack configuration.
*   `webpack.config.dev.js`: The development webpack configuration.
*   `webpack.config.prod.js`: The production webpack configuration.

## Next Steps

Here are some suggested next steps for this project:

*   Add a testing framework like Jest or Mocha.
*   Add a linter like ESLint to enforce code quality.
*   Add support for CSS preprocessors like Sass or Less.
*   Add a code formatter like Prettier to ensure consistent code style.
*   Add a continuous integration (CI) pipeline to automate the build and deployment process.
*   Add more features to the application.
